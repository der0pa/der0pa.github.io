I retired in 2018   

### More Information

I have perfected the grilled cheese sandwich.
- you grill it openfaced with olive oil not butter.
- you mound grated chees on each half.
- you cover with lip for last 3 minutes

You may already know. I have a blog. 


ps: My spelling is a·tro·cious! please overlook
