score. which means don't care about '_' this.

 175> // 6. you can exit a loop with break. nested loops need a label for the outer loop.
 176> // 7. you can skip item in a loop with 'continue'.
 177> // 8. beware of 'infinite' loops. make sure to include a condition that can eval to false a some point.
