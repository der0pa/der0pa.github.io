* Rust - a language for the future!

[Arrays and Slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/primitives/array.html#arrays-and-slices)

Jumping around to much... lets stay focused on basics


[rust book 13.1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html). 
Closures: Anonymous Functions that can 'Capture Their Environment'
define code in one place and execute that code where we acutally need the result. this is a case for 'closures'.

```rust
let expensive_closure = |num| {           //  params to closure between |..| 
    println!("calculating slowly...")     // body of closure
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_sec(2));
    num                                   // num will be the return value
};                                        // notice no ; after 'num'
```
or here with explict type annotation 
```rust
let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {     //  also OK
    println!("calculating slowly...")    
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_sec(2));
    num                                  
};                                       
```
```rust
// if the body of a closure is a single expression you can drop the curly-braces.  
// fn and closure diff. all lets are equal. fn add_one_v1 is a single expression.  no semi-colon at closing } bracket
fn add_one_v1    (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }  // a function named add_one_v1  
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 }; // a closure bound to add_one_v2 
let add_one_v3 = |x| { x + 1 }; // same as above  
let add_one_v4 = |x| x + 1  ; // drop curlies  
```

note: memoization == ```lazy evaluation```
