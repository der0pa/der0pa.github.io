```swift
Welcome to Swift version 5.0-dev (LLVM 8d1b92b83c, Swift 1755ac8aee).
Type :help for assistance.

  1> // Swift allows functions to be used like any other Type. 
  2> // Closures are functions that are assigned to a variable.
  3> // Here is a very simple closure in Swift:
  4> 
  5> let driving = { 
  6.     print("I'm driving my car") 
  7. } 
driving: () -> () =
  8> // Closures are effectively unnamed functions.
  9> driving()
I'm driving my car
 10>  
 11> // With closures you don't need to use labels: in params. 
 12> // here is a closure that accepts one param.
 13> let driving = { (place: String) in 
 14.     print("I'm going to \(place) in my car") 
 15. } 
driving: (String) -> () =
 16> driving("London")
I'm going to London in my car

 28> // here is our basic driving() closure again
 29> let driving = { 
 30.     print("I'm driving in my car")

 32> func travel(action: () -> Void) {

 37> travel
$R0: (() -> Void) -> () =
 38> // now call travel useing our driving closure
 39> travel(action: driving)
I'm getting ready to go.
I'm driving in my car
I arrived!

  1> // trailing closure syntax can be used if the last param to a function is a closure
  2>  
  3> // Here's our travel() function again.
  4> func travel(action: () -> Void) { 
  5.     print("I'm getting ready to go.")

// Summary for closures day 6

 75> // 1. You can assign closures to variables and call later 
 76> // 2. Closures accept params and return values like functions
 77> // 3. Closure can be parameters to functions. And those 
 78> //    closures can also have parameters and return values 
 79> // 4. If the last param to your function is a closure
 80> //    you can use 'trailing closure syntax'
 81> // 5. Swift provided shorthand param names with '$0, $1.. 
 82> // 6. You can use external values inside closures, they
 83> //    will be 'captured' and can be referenced later.
