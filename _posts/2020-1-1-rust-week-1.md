* Rust - a language for the future!

I am about to undertake writing a weekly blog post about Rust. 
this post is week 1 of 100. I figured it would take at least 2 years to 
become viable working with rust. for the first week i am going thru the first few chapters of the [the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)  

these posts will become my personal 'cook book' and are written as notes primarily for me. i am no writer by any means but i will do my best.
 
current dev enviornment:

* chromebook with a linux container
* vs-code with rust-language-server 
* jekyll web server installed locally 
* jekyll on github-pages [der0pa.github.io](https://der0pa.github.io) 
* set up for wasm / node  
* and  **Rust**
