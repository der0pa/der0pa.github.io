```swift

// initializers -default type 'memberwise'
struct User {
    var username: String 

    // add our own initializer:
    init() {
        username = "Anonymous"
        print("Creating a new user!")
    }
}

// create a 'User' struct like this

var user = User()
user.username = "twostraws"

// 'self' is a special constant inside each method
// 'self' points to the current instance being used
// 'self' helps to distinguish between 'property' and 'parameter'
// self.name refer to the property
// whereas 'name' refers to the parameter
// as in this:

struct Person {
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        print("\(name) was born!")
        self.name = name
    }
}

// lazy properties are created when it's first accessed

struct FamilyTree {
    init() {
        print("Creating family tree!")
    }
}

struct PersonLz {
    var name: String
    lazy var familyTree = FamilyTree()

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var ed = PersonLz(name: "Ed")
print(ed.familyTree)

// static properties and methods
// share properties across all instances using 'static'

struct Student {
    static var classSize = 0
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        Student.classSize += 1 // sum total of Students
    }
}

let edard = Student(name: "Ed") 
let taylor = Student(name: "Taylor") 

print("class size: ", Student.classSize)

// Access control using 'private'

struct PersonPrvt {
    private var id: String

    init(id: String) {
        self.id = id
    }
    func identify() -> String {
        return "My ID number:  \(id)"
    }
}

let edward = PersonPrvt(id: "12345")
print(edward)
// edward.id   'id' is inaccessible due to 'private' protection

/* day nine summary:

You can create your own types using structures, which can have their own properties and methods.

You can use stored properties or use computed properties to calculate values on the fly.

If you want to change a property inside a method, you must mark it as mutating.

Initializers are special methods that create structs. You get a memberwise initializer by default, but if you create your own you must give all properties a value.

Use the self constant to refer to the current instance of a struct inside a method.

The lazy keyword tells Swift to create properties only when they are first used.

You can share properties and methods across all instances of a struct using the static keyword.
Access control lets you restrict what code can use properties and methods.
